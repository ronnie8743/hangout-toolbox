# Hangout Toolbox Documentation #

This page will show you how to use the Hangout Toolbox.


# Installation #

To install this Hangout application/extension you have to load it once via the following link: http://goo.gl/fxPH3

By clicking this link it will open up a new Hangout and ask for permission to load the application/extension. Once you've granted access the application will load.

From there on you can find the app either in the top bar of the Hangout or under "Add App" -> "Recent"

# Usage #
When you open up the app/extension you will see an acordion menu on the left. This menu contains all apps which can be used simultanously. Just click on one of the apps to expand the menu and access the settings of each app.

### Lower Third ###
The Lower Third app allows you to display a lower third (graphical bar with your name on it) as an overlay on your video. You can also add a real time clock or a complete custom overlay. If you want to add an icon/logo to your lower third chose a file from your computer with the file selector. The best size for an icon is 75x75 pixel.

If you want to build a complete custom overlay, create a **transparent PNG** with the size 640x360 pixel. You can then load it with the second file selector as a custom overlay.

If you want to save your lower thirds or custom overlays, type in a name under "presets" and hit save while the lower third or custom overlay is active. Once you have saved presets, you can turn them on/off by clicking on the green plus icon or delete them by clicking on the red X.
